1) What is the definition of server port?

The answer is a way to identify a specific process to which an 
Internet or network message is to be forwarded to when it arrives at a server.
The Transmission Control Protocol and the User Datagram Protocol, define
a port number as a 16-bit integer that is appended to a message unit and put in the header.

2) What is server port range?

The answer is a way to categorize the identified processes running on the ports, using ranges. 
Ports with numbers 0â€“1023 are called system or well-known ports.
Registered ports are in the range 1024 to 49151. Dynamic ports are in the range 49152 to 65535. 
The total range is 0 to 65535 as that is the highest number you can form with 16 bits.

3) How many bits does number above represent?
65535 in binary is:
1111 1111 1111 1111 (which is the highest number able to be made with 16 bits)

4) State 10 common server ports

The answer is:

20 - File Transfer Protocol Data Transfer 
21 - File Transfer Protocol Command Control 
22 - Secure Shell (SSH) 
23 - Telnet 
25 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 
53 - Domain Name System (DNS) service
80 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
443 - HTTP Secure (HTTPS)
110 - Post Office Protocol (POP3)
143 - Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

bits		16	15	14	13	12	11	10	9	8	7	6	5	4	3	2	1
max vals	65,536	32768	16384	8192	4096	2048	1024	512	256	128	64	32	16	8	4	2

And the reason the highest port number is 65,535 and not 65,536 is that the port number 0 is used 
for one of those values.
